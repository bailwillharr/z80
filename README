rom/ contains the read only bootstrap code that receives a file via XMODEM and
jumps to it. It also contains some useful romcalls for interfacing with the
UART, among other things.

hello/ contains the program that is sent via XMODEM. This makes debugging
faster and prolongs the life of the EEPROM.

Assembly is done using 'zasm' and XMODEM transmission is done using 'sx' from
the 'lrzxz' package. The terminal 'st' is used to open a serial console for
communication with the Z80 computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After initialisation from the ROM, the Z80 computer waits for XMODEM
transmission to begin, and downloads the file to $8000 in memory.
The program counter then jumps to $8000 to begin program execution.
Memory banks $E0-$E3 are mapped, which corresponds to the first 4 RAM pages.
This allows the copy of ROM to be overwritten to implement things such as
interrupt handlers.
